## Project Genesis: Book4Us (PageTurners)

This document serves as a foundational record for the Book4Us project, internally known as "PageTurners." The project's inception stems from a comprehensive concept "brain dump" provided at the timestamp `2026-02-08T00:29:02.596Z`. This initial concept detailed the core problem PageTurners aims to solve for book clubs: coordinating meetings, tracking progress, and fostering focused discussions.

The concept outlined a robust solution, targeting avid readers and existing book clubs, emphasizing unique value propositions such as integrated book voting, granular reading progress tracking, and structured chapter-by-chapter discussion feeds. It also provided a complete blueprint covering:

*   **Key Features:** `club-creation-management`, `book-voting-selection`, `reading-progress-tracker`, `private-club-discussion-feeds`, `book-ratings-reviews`, `goodreads-integration`, `user-authentication-profiles`, and `notifications-alerts`.
*   **Application Pages:** `landing-page`, `auth-page`, `dashboard`, `my-clubs`, `individual-club-page`, `book-details-page`, `user-profile`, `settings`, and `create-edit-club`.
*   **Core User Flows:** `user-onboarding-club-creation`, `voting-for-next-club-book`, `track-progress-chapter-discussion`, and `goodreads-account-linking`.
*   **Database Schema:** Detailed collections for `users`, `book_clubs`, `books`, `club_members`, `club_votes`, and `discussions`.
*   **Design & Technical Stack:** High-level design principles and the chosen technology stack (Nuxt 4, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Goodreads API).

This import summary signifies the translation of a raw idea into a structured project definition, laying the groundwork for all subsequent development and documentation. It ensures that the core vision and initial specifications are preserved as the project evolves.
