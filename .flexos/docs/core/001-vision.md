## 1. Vision

To be the definitive digital space where every book club transforms into a thriving, connected, and deeply engaged community.

## 2. Mission

Our mission is to provide an intuitive, all-in-one platform that eliminates the administrative friction of running a book club. We empower members to focus on what truly matters: the joy of reading, the thrill of discovery, and the richness of shared discussion.

## 3. Strategic Roadmap

Our strategy is to build, engage, and then expand. We will roll out PageTurners in three distinct phases:

*   **Phase 1: The Core Loop (MVP)**: Our initial focus is on perfecting the fundamental experience for small, private book clubs. This involves creating a seamless flow from club creation to discussion. Key deliverables include the features outlined in our MVP scope in the [Features Doc](.flexos/docs/core/002-features.md): `user-authentication`, `club-creation-management`, `book-voting-selection`, `reading-progress-tracker`, and `private-club-discussion-feeds`. The goal is to validate that we solve the core problem for our target users effectively.

*   **Phase 2: Engagement & Discovery**: Once the core loop is stable and validated, we will introduce features that deepen engagement and allow for organic growth. This includes full `goodreads-integration` for richer data, a robust `notifications-alerts` system to drive re-engagement, and user-generated content via `book-ratings-reviews`. We may also explore features for discovering and joining public book clubs.

*   **Phase 3: Expansion & Monetization**: With an engaged user base, we will explore sustainable growth models. This could include premium features for large or corporate clubs (advanced analytics, moderation tools), affiliate partnerships with booksellers, or sponsored content from publishers and authors.

## 4. User Personas

We are building PageTurners for three primary user archetypes:

*   **Chloe, The Organizer (Admin Persona)**
    *   **Bio**: 32-year-old marketing manager who loves bringing people together. She started a book club with friends from college but finds it exhausting to manage everything through a chaotic group chat.
    *   **Pains**: Chasing people for book suggestions, manually creating polls, reminding everyone about meetings, and trying to avoid spoilers in general chat.
    *   **Needs**: A centralized tool to streamline book selection, track who's participating, and keep discussions organized. She wants to be an enthusiastic facilitator, not a nagging administrator.

*   **Ben, The Engaged Reader (Member Persona)**
    *   **Bio**: 28-year-old software developer. He's an avid reader and loves deep-diving into literary themes. He values structured conversation.
    *   **Pains**: He often reads ahead and is frustrated by the inability to discuss specific chapters without spoiling the book for others. He dislikes when discussions get sidetracked in a general chat.
    *   **Needs**: A dedicated space for chapter-specific discussions. He wants to see his friends' reading progress to feel a sense of shared journey and know who he can talk to about specific plot points.

*   **Maria, The Casual Participant (Member Persona)**
    *   **Bio**: 45-year-old teacher who joined the book club to stay social and discover books she wouldn't normally pick up.
    *   **Pains**: She sometimes forgets when to vote for the next book or loses track of which book was chosen. She's busy and can fall behind.
    *   **Needs**: Clear, gentle reminders about club activities (e.g., voting deadlines). An easy-to-access dashboard showing the current book and club progress helps her stay in the loop without feeling pressured.

## 5. Success Metrics (KPIs)

We will measure our success against the following key performance indicators:

*   **Activation Rate**: Percentage of new sign-ups who create or join their first book club within 7 days. (Target: >40%)
*   **Engagement**: 
    *   Club Activity Ratio: The number of clubs that select a new book and have at least 10 discussion posts per month.
    *   Weekly Active Members: Percentage of members in active clubs who update their reading progress at least once a week.
*   **Retention**: 30-day and 90-day user retention. We want to see users staying active across multiple book cycles.
*   **Task Success**: The percentage of voting rounds that successfully result in a new book selection within the allotted time.
