# Project Overview

## Vision

Your digital home for vibrant book club discussions and shared reading journeys.

## Problem

Many book clubs struggle with coordinating meetings, choosing books, tracking members' reading progress, and maintaining a focused discussion space beyond scattered group chats or emails. It's hard to keep everyone engaged and on the same page, leading to dwindling participation and less enriching experiences.

## Solution

PageTurners provides a dedicated platform for book clubs to thrive. It streamlines book selection through integrated voting, offers tools to track individual and club-wide reading progress, and creates a private, structured environment for chapter-by-chapter discussions, ensuring every member stays connected and engaged.

## Target User

Avid readers who are part of, or want to start, a book club. This includes friends, family groups, community organizations, and even corporate teams looking to foster reading habits and discussions. They value organized communication, shared progress, and a dedicated space for their literary conversations.
